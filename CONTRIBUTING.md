Thank you for wanting to contribute! :smiley:

# Before contributing
- If it's a code contribution, please familiarise yourself with our 
  [style guide](https://presentedbykaran.com/bookshelf-styleguide).
  
- Please inform us of the change you want to make before doing it. This way, we can ensure that people aren't working 
  on the same thing (we'll assign the task to you if it hasn't already been assigned). To see a list of things we are 
  currently working on, check out our public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mrCyzYwZ).
  
- Please create a new branch for your changes and submit a pull request

If you're confused about some of the terminology we use, check out our dedicated [Terminology wiki page](https://github.com/knjk04/Bookshelf/wiki/Terminology). 
If what you're looking for isn't there or you're unsure about something, raise an issue as a question and 
we'll get back to you.

# Feature request

Got an idea for a new feature? We'd love to hear from you. Please raise an issue detailing what feature you would like us to include in the app and a short description (a sentence or two) explaining why you think we should include it (sell it  to us!).

We have a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mrCyzYwZ) for stuff that needs doing, with a special label 
for features. It's a public board that anyone can view, comment or upvote on. Only team members can add cards for now. We will consider inviting active contributors to the repository to become a team member on Trello.

# Style guide
Go to our [Style guide made with Slate](https://presentedbykaran.com/bookshelf-styleguide) if you're wanting to push some code.

We kindly request that commit messages use the present tense.
