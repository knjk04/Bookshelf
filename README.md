  Android app that uses the Google Books API to let you search for book titles 
  and/or authors, which you can save to a wishlist (WIP)

  Currently, you can only search for book titles. The wishlist part of the app 
  hasn't been developed yet
  
  Min SDK version: API level 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop)
  
  This app has been tested on a Pixel XL running Android Pie (API 28).
  
# Features
  - Search for a book title and get a list of the top results showing the book
	title, the corresponding author, the rating of the book on Google Books and
	the number of ratings
	
  - Voice search
  
  And more on its way!
  
# Setup
  Add your Google Books API key into /app/src/main/res/raw/api_key.txt (it was 
  added to the .gitignore of this project, so you will need to create your own
  raw directory and your own api_key.txt file).
  
  The file should only contain your API key without quotes or any blank lines.
